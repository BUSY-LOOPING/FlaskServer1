# FlaskServer1

## A very basic python server serving requests by converting query parameter to its ascii value.

A demo app implementing very basic flask server


- Make sure you have python installed.
- Install flask using pip ```pip install flask```
- To run the server ```python api.py```
- Server is now running on localhost - <http://127.0.0.1:5000> and <http://192.168.29.108:5000>
- Api calls to ```GET /api``` with query as parameter.

  Example - 
  
  <http://127.0.0.1:5000/api?query=a>
  
  <http://192.168.29.108:5000/api?query=a>
